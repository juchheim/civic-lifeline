# Civic Lifeline — Delta Edition: Product Vision

## One-liner
A no-fake-data, live-sourced help hub that connects Mississippi Delta residents to food access, benefits guidance, jobs/skills insights, broadband information, and housing help—powered by verified public datasets and clearly labeled AI guidance.

## Problem
Low-income residents (primarily rural and Black communities) struggle to locate trustworthy, up-to-date resources for essentials (food, jobs, housing, internet). Existing information is fragmented, stale, or paywalled; “placeholder” data erodes trust.

## Our Beliefs
- **Truth over theater**: Never seed fake listings. If data is empty, we say so plainly.
- **Provenance everywhere**: Every fact shows its source and freshness.
- **Dignity by design**: Friendly visuals, plain language, mobile-first, accessible.

## What It Is (MVP Scope)
- **Food Access Map**: Live SNAP-accepting retailers on an interactive map.
- **Benefits & Rights Coach (AI)**: Plain-language steps + official links; letter templates (e.g., repair request).
- **Jobs & Skills Pulse**: County unemployment trend (live BLS series) + resume/cover builder.
- **Digital Access**: County/tract broadband summaries from FCC downloads.
- **Housing Starter**: HUD housing counselors near me + FMR context.

## What It Isn’t
- A classifieds site with synthetic posts.
- A legal advisor (we provide guidance + links, not legal advice).
- A data hoarder; we store only what’s needed, with explicit retention.

## Non-negotiables
- No fake data in UI.
- Clear **Source** badge + **Last updated** timestamp on every dataset panel.
- Graceful, honest empty states with “how to help/fix” actions.

## Success Metrics (MVP)
- Task success: ≥80% users can find a SNAP retailer within 3 steps.
- Data trust: ≥90% users report “I trust the info” (post-task survey).
- Reliability: ≥99.5% API uptime; <1s p95 for cached reads.
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.2 AA audit pass.

## North Star
Become the most trusted community utility in the Delta for finding help—elevating lives through accurate data, respectful design, and practical AI.
