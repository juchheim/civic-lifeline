# Empty States

## Principles
- Be honest; never imply existence of data that isn’t present.
- Offer next steps (zoom out, adjust filters, contribute info).

## Templates
- **Food**: “No retailers in this view. Try zooming out or searching another area.”
- **Housing**: “No counselors within 30 miles. Increase radius or call 211.”
- **Broadband**: “No summary available for this county (data vintage: …). Check back soon.”
- **Jobs**: “No series available for this county yet. Choose another county or try later.”
