PROMPT 10 — Final verification & handoff

Upon completion, provide a “DONE” report with the five checkmarks (files changed count, API ready, fonts active, privacy/logging OK, deploy notes).

Final checks:

1) Run (or simulate) 3 test calls for templates: classic, modern, minimal.
2) Confirm each returns a PDF > 1KB, with selectable text (not raster).
3) Summarize “How to Test” for humans:
   - curl command
   - expected headers & filename
   - where to change templates
4) Summarize “How to Revert”:
   - list files created/replaced
   - single git revert command or stash pop guidance

Return a compact “DONE” report with:
- ✅ Files changed (count)
- ✅ API ready
- ✅ Fonts active
- ✅ Privacy/logging
- ✅ Deploy notes
Stop and wait.
