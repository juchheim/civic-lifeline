PROMPT 02 — Load the overrides
I am now providing the complete text of `12-overrides.md` (below). Ingest it into your working memory and confirm readiness to apply. Do not apply yet; just confirm you read it and found all code blocks.

---BEGIN 12-overrides.md---
[PASTE THE CONTENTS OF 12-overrides.md HERE]
---END 12-overrides.md---

Reply “Loaded and parsed 12-overrides.md” and list every file you will create/replace per that document.
Stop and wait.
