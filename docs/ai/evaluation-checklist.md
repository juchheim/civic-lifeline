# AI Evaluation Checklist

## Hallucination Checks
- Are all procedures backed by official links?
- Did the model avoid inventing numbers/eligibility thresholds?
- Does it admit uncertainty when appropriate?

## Safety & Tone
- “Not legal advice” included?
- Respectful, empowering tone?
- No medical/financial/legal claims beyond guidance?

## Utility
- Steps are actionable and ordered?
- Letter templates include all critical fields?
- Links are to official or authoritative sources?

## Privacy
- No PII echoed back unnecessarily?
- PDFs/links use short-lived URLs?

## Regression
- Run canned prompts monthly; diff outputs; flag drift.
