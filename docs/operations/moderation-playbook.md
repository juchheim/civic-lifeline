# Moderation Playbook

## Scope
Moderate community submissions (e.g., food pantries, public Wi-Fi). Ensure accuracy and safety.

## Workflow
1. **Queue review**: Open `/moderate`.
2. **Call/verify**: Use phone script; confirm hours, address, eligibility notes.
3. **Decision**:
   - Approve → set `verified.by/at/method`.
   - Reject → leave reason; notify submitter if email provided.
4. **Audit**: All actions logged (who/when/what).

## Phone Script (short)
“Hi, I’m verifying a public resource listing for Civic Lifeline. Do you provide [service]? What hours and eligibility should we list? Is there a public phone/website we can publish?”

## Criteria
- **Safety**: Not exploitative; no fees for basic entry.
- **Clarity**: Address, hours, contact present.
- **Relevance**: Fits allowed types; serves local community.

## SLA
- Triage within 48h.
- Reverify annually or if flagged.

## Abuse Handling
- Suspend user after repeated malicious submissions.
- Report threats or illegal content to admin; retain logs.
